# HTML
This webpage accepts password ideas from users and ensures that the input meets the requirements listed on the page. If the input received does not meet the standards, an error message will be displayed, informing the user that their password is insufficient. 

### How to use this page: 
Type in a password idea and try to meet all of the requirements. Click the “check” button once you have typed in a password to test its strength. 

### Note: 
Pressing the “enter” key after typing in the password will not trigger the page. The “check” button must be clicked in order for the password to be analyzed by the JavaScript file. 

# JavaScript 
The JavaScript file contains the functions necessary for the page to react to user input. Once the user clicks the “check” button, the functions take the password that the user has typed in and checks its length as well as its contents.
